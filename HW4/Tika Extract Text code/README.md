Code has been slightly modified from the version I submitted.

## Objective

> You may want to adopt a version of Norvig’s spelling program written in PhP and run it on your server.  
>
> Norvig’s spell correction program uses a text file(‘’big.txt”) to get set of words to calculate edit distance. For this you should create your own “big.txt” for your specified news website.
