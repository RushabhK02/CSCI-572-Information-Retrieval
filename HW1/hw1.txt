As part of homework 1, the comparison of the top 10 search results from Google and DuckDuckGo shows that the two search engines rank links using different parameters 
since the max overlap over 100 queries was a max of 5 results but found in different order. The spearman coefficient value is negative or zero for most of the queries, signifying 
negative association or no association of ranks of results from the two search engines. This points towards little or no overlap in the ranking algorithm used by the two search 
engines. The average rho is -3.824 which signifies dissimilar ranking between the results and the magnitude signifies the distance between the ranking of the same result by the 
search engines. The average overlap across 100 queries was 1.61 results or 16.1 percent, further reinforcing the belief that the two engines prioritize different parameters in 
their search.
